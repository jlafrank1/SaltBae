# The Project

> It's time to get excited and put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For your first project, you'll build a full stack web application using Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.<br>
> The objective of this project is to:
> - Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
> - Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.
> - Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.

## Technology Focus
Full stack web application using [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud)
- Express, node js
- RESTful routing conventions
- Templating with EJS
- MongoDB with multiple database relations
- Collaborative coding with git
- [Professional code structure](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Deployed with Heroku
- Documentation

***Code is: ⚡︎ CLEAN ⚡︎ MODULAR ⚡︎ ORGANIZED ⚡︎ !***


## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wc-seir-726/project-one/blob/master/planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.

-   A clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week?
-   **Wireframes** for _every_ page. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the page will include.
-   **User Stories** (divided into sprints) - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
-   **Database Models and ERD** Make plans for each resource. List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=database%20table%20relationships%20drawing) to illustrate the relationship(s) between models, and note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.
-   A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete.

Once your project has been approved, create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your teaching team as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).
